*An incremental idle game of cosmic consequence and endless harvesting.*

> The last star has flickered out. The universe has succumbed to entropy, its once-vibrant energies fading into a cold, silent void. Yet, not all is lost. You are a Soul Collector, an ancient and powerful entity existing outside of time, tasked with a monumental purpose: to harvest the lingering echoes of lifeâ€”the soulsâ€”before they fade into nothingness.
>
> Your vessel is the Soul Core, a nexus of unimaginable power. By channeling the harvested souls into it, you can generate Dark Essence, the concentrated memory of existence. With this essence, you can bind artifacts of immense power and enslave demonic minions to automate your harvest.
>
> Your ultimate goal is to gather enough power to trigger an Ascensionâ€”a controlled universal collapse and rebirth. By shattering your Soul Core, you will unleash its collected energy, creating a new universe from the ashes of the old. The Abyssal Shards left behind from this cataclysm are fragments of a previous reality, and they will grant you exponentially greater power in the next cycle.
>
> Begin the harvest. The Omega Point awaits.

## How to Play

Your journey to universal rebirth is a long one. Hereâ€™s how to begin your harvest.

### The Basics: Souls
Your primary currency is **Souls**.
1.  **Harvest Manually:** Click the large **"Harvest Soul"** button to gain souls. The amount you get is your **Souls Per Click (SPC)**.
2.  **First Upgrade:** Your first purchase should be **"Empower Harvest"**. This increases your SPC, making your clicks more valuable.

### Automation: Minions & SPS
Manually clicking is slow. You need to automate the harvest.
1.  **Navigate:** Go to the **"Minions"** tab.
2.  **Purchase Minions:** Use your Souls to purchase minions like Imps and Ghouls. Each minion you buy adds to your **Souls Per Second (SPS)**, harvesting souls for you automatically, even when you're not clicking.
3.  **Level Them Up:** Buying more of the same minion increases its level, making it more efficient.

### The First Prestige Currency: Dark Essence
To gain true power, you need a more refined currency.
1.  **Sacrifice Souls:** On the main "Altar" screen, once you have enough souls, you can click the **"Sacrifice Souls"** button. This converts a large number of souls into **Dark Essence**. The cost of sacrificing increases each time.
2.  **Purchase Artifacts:** Navigate to the **"Artifacts"** tab. Here, you can spend your Dark Essence on powerful, permanent upgrades that persist even after you Ascend. These are some of the most important upgrades in the game.

### The Main Prestige Loop: Ascension & Abyssal Shards
This is the core mechanic for long-term progress.
1.  **Unlock Ascension:** To unlock the ability to Ascend, you must first progress through the **Worlds** (on the "Worlds" tab) until you unlock the **"Void Threshold"**.
2.  **What Ascension Does:** When you Ascend, you will **reset your current progress**. This includes your Souls, Dark Essence (spent on non-artifact upgrades), Minions, and unlocked Worlds.
3.  **What You Gain:** In exchange, you will gain **Abyssal Shards**. The number of shards you get is based on the total number of souls you have harvested during that run.
4.  **The Power of Shards:** Abyssal Shards provide a **MASSIVE permanent multiplier** to all soul gains in your next life and all future lives. Your first Ascension will feel slow, but your second run will be dramatically faster, allowing you to reach your previous point of progress in a fraction of the time.

### Multiplayer: Raids & Leaderboards
You are not the only Soul Collector in the void.
1.  **Find Opponents:** Go to the **"Raids"** tab and click "Find New Opponents". The game will find other players in the database who are at a similar power level to you.
2.  **Raid:** Click the "Raid" button to begin a simulated duel against another player's saved data.
3.  **Win/Lose:** If you win, you steal a percentage of their souls. If you lose, they steal some of yours.
4.  **Climb:** Winning raids increases your PvP Wins, helping you climb the **Leaderboards** (found on its own tab).

Good luck, Soul Collector.
